# Python-FIRMA-UI-IMPORTANT
Hello there !
This is a UI script for a company or for a startup. You have your username/login and UEC (User Entry Code). I added an UEC for more security. 
I made some generators for the database and for the UEC code because I had to have something to work with, so I made a generator.
Normally you would build it up yourself, with your usernames/passwords/UEC-codes but I had to use a generator to pretend that it is like a company.
The programm is very secure and I've build some projects like this for different other companies and startups when I was a freelancer. 
I hope that you like this project.
For questions/informations or errors contact me.
